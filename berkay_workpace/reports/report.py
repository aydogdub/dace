# TODO: GENERAL, discuss with Yakup
# 1.  Modularity for Deallocate?
# 2.  KernelScopeManager: What I like:
#     - simple, easy to understand, modular and clean
#     what I dont like:
#     - Kind of messes with _generate_exit and how dace generates code
#     Your opinion? do or dont?
# 3.  __syncthread example ? Or better: General examples?
# 3.5  See below
# 4.  GPU streams- now or wait?
# 5.  Config for thread_id - why is this even a config?
# 6.  Used no instrumentation because I have no clue what it is

# I think the rest can wait before getting refactored (I don't need to reinvent the wheel)
# New tasks for now?

# My personal TODO's
# TODO: when tired
# include constant expressions
# 4 dimensional example

# TODO: depending on what happens next
# change in_device_code to maybe in_kernel_code?
