1. CudaEvents are a bit a mix in the codegen. I left it as an attribute in the GPUStreamManager class, but I do not work with CudaEvents.
   I left it there because it may be implemented in future and more importantly, the GPU code template (in get_generated_codeobject())
   depends on it. Instead of removing it, I decided to let it be and just say 0 CudaEvents are created and used.
   Generally: The CudaStreamManager assumes that the NaiveGPUScheduler pass was called before.
   Also, the CudaStreamManager should define the functions "get_stream_edge" (and maybe "get_stream_node"), since the the copystrategies might
   depend on it
